## **Fintech Space and Women Empowerment :**

Can fintech close the gender gap in access to financial services ? Using novel survey data for 28 countries, this paper finds a large and ubiquitous ‘fintech gender gap’: while 29% of men use [fintech] products, only 21% of women do. This difference exceeds the gender gap in bank account ownership at traditional financial institution. While country characteristics and individual-level controls explain about a third of the fintech gender gap, the residual gap declines by 60% when accounting for gender differences in the willingness to use new financial technology, the suitability of fintech products, and the willingness to use fintech entrants if they offer cheaper products. The paper concludes by discussing drivers of differences in attitudes and implications for policy to foster financial inclusionwith new technology.

Fintech companies are reshaping the way we interact with money and financial services, and their impact goes beyond just convenience and efficiency. A fintech, or financial technology company, is an innovative organization that leverages digital technology to provide a wide range of financial services, including digital banking, mobile payments and microfinance. Fintechs often utilize cutting-edge technology, such as blockchain and cryptocurrency, to enhance financial transparency and sustainability, contributing to the broader goals of sustainable finance and impact investing.

One crucial area where fintechs are making a difference is in driving financial inclusion, particularly for women. The statistics are telling – from the gender disparity in venture capital funding to the lack of formal financial access for women globally. Digital financial services can serve as an on-ramp for low-income women to adopt and use a large suite of formal financial products and services, expanding women’s choices and their financial and economic resilience and empowerment. Low-income women represent a large, untapped market opportunity for digital financial services providers, particularly fintechs leveraging technology to close the gender gap in financial services.
